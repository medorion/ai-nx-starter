# Fix Build Errors Prompt

## Description
Debug and fix TypeScript compilation errors systematically.

## Prompt

```
I ran `npm run build` and got errors. Please help fix them:

Error Output:
[PASTE_ERROR_OUTPUT_HERE]

Instructions:
1. Analyze each error carefully
2. Explain the root cause
3. Provide the fix with exact file path and line number
4. Apply the fix
5. After each fix, verify with: npm run build
6. Continue until all errors are resolved

Common Issues to Check:
- Missing imports
- Type mismatches
- Undefined properties
- Circular dependencies
- Missing @ai-nx-starter/* package references
- Outdated API client (run: npm run gen-api-client if needed)

For each fix:
- Explain WHY the error occurred
- Show the corrected code
- Mention if similar errors might exist elsewhere
```

## Expected Outcome

- All TypeScript errors resolved
- Clean build: `npm run build` passes
- Explanation of what was fixed and why

## Example Usage

```
I ran `npm run build` and got errors:

Error Output:
```
apps/web-ui/src/app/features/products/product-list.component.ts:45:12 - error TS2339:
