# Monorepo Kit

An Nx-based monorepo for full-stack application development with Angular frontend and NestJS backend.

> 🤖 **AI-First Development**: This project is optimized for AI-assisted development with Claude Code and Windsurf. Built-in rules and patterns enable rapid feature development with minimal manual coding.

**Clear And Well Defined Stucrure**:
This project provides strict rules and patterns for the development of full-stack applications with Angular frontend and NestJS backend.
This makes it optimized for AI assisted development.

**UI**:

- Exept from some usecases, UI is generated automatically by AI and strictly uses ng-zorro components in order to avoid "spagetti code" in the codebase.
- Under core folder we have predefined decorators, services and components that will simplify the development process and AI is instucted to use them. i.e Logging , Events, PubSub, etc.
- Auto generated apiClient for angular frontend is available in packages/api-client

**Backend**:

- Backend is built with NestJS and provides strict rules and patterns for the development of backend.
- Well defined data access leayer with single responsibility principle. i.e Only DbServices are allowed to access database.

**Packages**:

- Types and DTO trough packages/types, whgich is used both on server and client side.
- Shared entities through packages/data-access-layer.
- Shared services and decorators through packages/backend-common.

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 🛠️ Development Commands

### Generate API Client

After creating or updating backend controllers, regenerate the API client for the frontend:

```bash

**Check formatting:**

```bash
npm run format:check
```

**Fix formatting:**

```bash
npm run format:fix
```

```bash
npx nx run-many --target=lint --all
```

### Testing

```bash
npx nx run-many --target=test --all
```

## 🐳 Docker

### Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

This project is designed for **AI-assisted development** with tools like **Claude Code** and **Windsurf**. Both tools automatically apply project-specific rules and coding standards based on your working directory.

#### AI Configuration

- **Claude Code**: Rules in `.claude/` directories (auto-applied per context)
- **Windsurf**: Rules in `.windsurf/rules/` (auto-applied with triggers)

Both tools automatically understand:

- Project architecture and patterns
- Coding standards and conventions
- Package dependencies and boundaries
- Best practices for each layer

**You don't need to explain the project structure** - just start coding and the AI will follow the established patterns!

### 📋 Feature Development Workflow

When implementing a new feature, follow this AI-assisted workflow:

#### Step 1: Identify Your Feature Pattern

**Before starting**, check if your feature matches an existing example pattern:

```bash
# Browse available examples
apps/web-ui/src/app/features/examples/
├── list-item/          # CRUD with list + detail view (most common)
├── forms/              # Complex form validation
├── buttons/            # Action-based features
├── decorators/         # Using utility decorators
├── exceptions/         # Error handling patterns
├── pub-sub/            # Real-time updates
└── server-events-demo/ # SSE/WebSocket patterns
```

**Most common pattern**: `list-item` - Use this for typical CRUD operations with list and detail views.

#### Step 2: Tell the AI What You Need

Simply describe your feature to Claude Code or Windsurf:

```
"Create a Product CRUD feature following the list-item pattern"
"Add a User management feature with list and detail views"
"Implement a Settings form with validation"
```

The AI will automatically:

- Create entities and DTOs in the right packages
- Generate backend controllers and services
- Follow naming conventions and architecture rules
- Apply proper validation and error handling

#### Step 3: Implement Backend (AI-Assisted)

**Example prompts for Claude Code/Windsurf:**

```
"Create a Product entity with name, description, and price fields in data-access-layer"
```

The AI will:

- Create entity in `packages/data-access-layer/src/product/`
- Create DTOs in `packages/types/dto/product/`
- Generate DbService with CRUD operations
- Follow TypeORM and MongoDB patterns

```
"Implement Product API controller and service in web-server"
```

The AI will:

- Create controller with REST endpoints
- Create service with business logic
- Create mapper for Entity ↔ DTO conversion
- Apply validation and exception handling

#### Step 4: Generate API Client

```bash
npm run gen-api-client
```

This auto-generates TypeScript API client services for the frontend.

#### Step 5: Implement Frontend (AI-Assisted)

**Example prompt:**

```
"Implement Product feature UI based on the list-item example"
```

The AI will:

- Analyze the `list-item` example pattern
- Create component structure (list, detail, form)
- Use ng-zorro components (nz-table, nz-card)
- Apply proper styling with theme variables
- Implement state management with services
- Add proper error handling and notifications

#### Step 6: Build and Validate

```bash
npm run build
```

The AI will typically run this automatically after each step to ensure no errors.

### 🎯 Tips for AI-Assisted Development

**✅ Do:**

- Reference existing examples: "based on list-item pattern"
- Be specific about requirements: "with pagination and search"
- Ask to follow patterns: "using the same structure as examples"
- Request validation after changes: "run build to check for errors"

**❌ Avoid:**

- Explaining the entire architecture (AI already knows from rules)
- Manually copying boilerplate (let AI generate it)
- Skipping the build step (always validate changes)

### 📚 Documenting Complex Features for AI

When you have a complete, well-implemented feature that should serve as a reference for future development, create a comprehensive markdown guide similar to the **Users feature example**:

**Reference**: [`apps/web-ui/src/app/features/backoffice/users/users.md`](apps/web-ui/src/app/features/backoffice/users/users.md)

This example demonstrates how to document a feature for AI consumption:

#### What to Include:

> **Note**: Exclude any general rules already defined in `.claude/instructions.md`. Focus only on feature-specific patterns, implementations, and architectural decisions unique to this feature.

#### Why This Matters:

- **AI Context**: Claude Code/Windsurf can reference these guides to understand complex implementations
- **Consistency**: New features follow established patterns automatically
- **Onboarding**: New developers (human or AI) can learn from comprehensive examples
- **Maintenance**: Clear documentation makes refactoring and updates easier

#### When to Create Feature Documentation:

- ✅ Complex features with multiple components (CRUD, forms, workflows)
- ✅ Features that establish patterns to be reused across the app
- ✅ Features with non-trivial business logic or integrations
- ✅ Reference implementations for specific UI/UX patterns

#### How AI Uses These Docs:

When you say:

```
"Create a Products feature similar to the Users feature"
```

The AI will:

1. Read `users.md` to understand the pattern
2. Identify key components and their responsibilities
3. Replicate the architecture with appropriate entity names
4. Follow the same code patterns and styling conventions
5. Maintain consistency with the reference implementation

**Pro Tip**: Place feature documentation in the feature folder (e.g., `features/users/users.md`) so Claude Code automatically sees it when working in that context.
