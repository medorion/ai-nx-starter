### Developer Quote

> "I was skeptical about AI code generation, but AI-Nx-Starter changed my mind. The structured prompts and auto-generation eliminated the trial-and-error. I'm building features in 30-40 minutes that used to take 2-3 hours, with better code quality. It's not magic - it's systematic AI leverage."
